# Game_Loop

Learning game loops course by Pikuma

#### Course objectives:

1. Learn about game loops

   1. while loop with three steps:
      1. process_input(), update(), and render()
2. Implement setup(), process_input(), update(), and render()
3. Learn about delta time, FPS, processing time per frame.
4. Delta time:

   1. It is done by calling a timer every frame per second that holds the time between now and last call in [milliseconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milliseconds "Milliseconds"). Thereafter the resulting number (Delta Time) is used to calculate how far, for instance, a [video game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game "Video game") character would have travelled during that time. This results in the character taking the same amount of real world time to move across the screen regardless of the rate of update, and whether the delay is caused by lack of processing power or a slow internet connection.
5. Collision detection (buggy but works)

   #### TO RUN:
6. git clone the repo.
7. cd to the repo
8. make build
9. mkae run and play
